## Background

The objective of this project is to provide a Jekyll theme that is line by line perfect replica of “Startbootstrap - Agency” and at the same time to be so dynamic that can be used as a starting point for   child themes.

Currently the only difference between “Startbootstrap – Agency” and jekyll-theme-startbootstrap-agency as served with the default content is found in the final `css/agency.min.css` which is normal since the scss is compiled by different engines.

https://github.com/y7kim/agency-jekyll-theme has not been updated for more that a year and it is still based in Bootstrap 3


## Features:
- MIT License
- Built to support the latest, stable releases of all major browsers and platforms.
- Fully responsive HTML template created with Bootstrap 4
- Custom collapsing navigation with active classes, smooth page scrolling, and responsive fallback stylings
- Services section with CSS only circle icons by Font Awesome
- Portfolio grid with modal window popup previews for portfolio item details
- About section with a responsive timeline, special thanks to Bootsnipp
- Team member section with circle profile images and social media links
- Contact form with validation - just add your server url to the `js-url` at `_data/home.yml`
- Footer with social links, copyright information, and other links
- SCSS files included for deeper customization options

This project is intended to be a safe, welcoming space for collaboration, and contributors are expected to adhere to the [Contributor Covenant](http://contributor-covenant.org) code of conduct.

## Development

To set up your environment to develop this theme, run `bundle install`.

The theme is setup just like a normal Jekyll site! To test the theme, run `bundle exec jekyll serve` and open your browser at `http://localhost:4000`. This starts a Jekyll server using the theme. Edit pages, documents, data, etc. like normal to test the theme's contents. As you make modifications to the theme and to the content, your site will regenerate and you should see the changes in the browser after a refresh, just like normal.
